## Overview
This workflow automates the process of notifying users about new emails via Telegram and temporarily hosting the email content on a secret HTML page. It is ideal for users who need immediate notifications and a secure, temporary web view of their email content.

## Use Cases
- Immediate notification of new emails in Telegram with the ability to preview the email content in a secure, temporary HTML format.
- Automation for users who need to keep track of their emails without constantly checking their email client.
- Useful for teams or individuals who require instant updates on critical emails and prefer a quick preview through a web interface.

## My Personal Use Case: Secure Subscription Sharing
From time to time, I find myself wanting to share my paid subscriptions with friends, but giving out OTP codes manually or sharing my email isn't a good idea due to security concerns. I attempted to use the IMAP node to integrate with Telegram secret channel for this purpose but encountered numerous problems, such as difficulties in scraping content from emails. Additionally, the Telegram API sometimes rejects certain special characters found within email contents. After facing these challenges, I discovered that rendering emails as HTML pages and sharing them directly is the most effective solution. This approach bypasses the issues with character limitations and content scraping, providing a seamless way to share subscription benefits securely.
