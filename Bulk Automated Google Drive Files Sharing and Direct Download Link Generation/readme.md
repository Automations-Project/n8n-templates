### How It Works

1. **Initialize Workflow**: The process begins with a Manual Trigger, allowing the user to start the workflow at their convenience.
2. **Folder ID Specification**: A 'Set Folder ID' node where the user can enter the desired Google Drive Folder ID.
3. **List Files from Google Drive**: The 'Google Drive' node lists all files within the specified folder using OAuth2 authentication.
4. **Batch Processing**: The 'Loop Over Items' node processes the files in batches for efficiency.
5. **Generate Public Links**: The 'Generate Download Links' node creates downloadable links for each file.
6. **Change File Access**: The 'Change Status' node alters the file status to make them publicly accessible.
7. **Merge and Output**: A 'Merge' node consolidates the data, preparing it for further actions or output.

### Set Up Steps

* **Estimated Time**: The setup should take approximately 10-15 minutes.
* **Initial Setup**: You'll need to provide OAuth2 credentials for Google Drive and specify a folder ID.
* **Customization**: Adjust the batch size and file access permissions according to your needs.
